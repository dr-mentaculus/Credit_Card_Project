# Credit_Card_Project

This is a series of projects using Credit Card data. Summary slideshows of the projects can be found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/38tcjlw7gb7bvka/AABsPtsNWq7yXZpuBqO1-_qNa?dl=0).

This project uses credit card data for 30,000 anonymous credit card clients in Taiwan. It presents information on the customers (education, sex, marital status, age) and their behavior for a six-month period from April 2005 to September 2005. The information was [downloaded in CSV format from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/default-of-credit-card-clients-dataset) and was uploaded to Kaggle from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository.

The project has two parts completed, and two more coming. Part I trains and evaluates different machine learning models. Part II runs statistical tests and a few bootstrapping and permutation simulations on the data. Parts III and IV will be up in a few days.

The "classes_n_functions" file includes the classes and functions I wrote for the first project, so that I can easily import them for use in later projects.

Questions and criticisms are always appreciated, so feel free to email me at derek.clayton.baker@gmail.com.
